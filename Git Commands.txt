Pip commands:-
Pip install Flask==1.1.1 (Specific version)
Pip install Flask (Defaults to latest version)

Py –m pip freeze > requirements.txt
Py –m pip install -r requirements.txt

Procfile:- without extension
web: gunicorn app:app

======================
Switch to the Project Directory first:-
================ 1.Follow the Commands =====================

git init
git branch // * indicates the current branch on which we are switched
git branch -a // shows all branches
git checkout -b raghu
git branch // * indicates the current branch on which we are switched
git status
git add C:/Users/Raghunadh/Desktop/Projects/abc/Raghu.java
(or)
git add .
git status
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -m raghu
git remote add origin https://github.com/9394113857/xyz.git
git push -u origin raghu // push for Git folder

====================== 2.Only File Changes =============================

git status // firstly red so add now some changes done, so immediately add this file and commit and push
git add Raghu.java // added changes to the repository now
git status // Shows green color now, Which means to commit and push.
git restore Raghu.java // to discard changes in the working directory
git add Raghu.java







============3.When you execute two git commands simultaneously============ 

Try deleting index.lock file in your .git directory.

rm -f .git/index.lock

Such problems generally occur when you execute two git commands simultaneously; maybe one from the command prompt and one from an IDE.

======================= 4.Only Changes =======================

git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin raghu

============== 

git branch -a => Displays all branches
git checkout raghu => Switched to raghu branch

Yes, it's executing

==============

Use Pipenv or other tools is recommended for improving your development flow.
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt # Python3 pip freeze > requirements.txt # Python2
If you do not use a virtual environment, pigar will be a good choice for you.
